The base of this game is written in ruby using the RPG maker IDE for windows XP (*Fancy huh?*) and uses a student modified version of PokémonEssentials repository. **NOTE: This project _temporarily_ used tile-sets similar to those in Pokémon video games but replaced them with Team Member made assets. This is an _Educational_ project and _is not for monetary gain nor marketed to the public_, but rather local Students and Faculty. **
